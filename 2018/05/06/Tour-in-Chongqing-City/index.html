        <p>In this Labour Day, I have planned a tour to the Chongqing City with my twin brother and his girl friend. Indeed, I have been to this city when I was a young boy, and I have forgot all the stuff, cause I was too little at that time. All in all, I would illustrate what I have done in Chongqing City at this vacation, and how I feel about it.</p>
<h2 id="Day-One"><a href="#Day-One" class="headerlink" title="Day One"></a>Day One</h2><h3 id="Catch-up-Tickets"><a href="#Catch-up-Tickets" class="headerlink" title="Catch up Tickets"></a>Catch up Tickets</h3><p>Haha, I have to admit that it has been a long time that I did not try to go for a tour by train, cause I don’t need to. But in this morning, to catch up the train, I get up earlier, and take a metro to the Chengdu East Railway station. However, in this process, it actually scares me, for the time is very tight, and we hardly cannot catch the train to our destination. Fortunately, in the help of a strange aunt, we got enough time to get our tickets, and finally, catch up the train.</p>
<h3 id="Meet-with-Girl"><a href="#Meet-with-Girl" class="headerlink" title="Meet with Girl"></a>Meet with Girl</h3><p>During the time on the train, I did not do anything which is special, just listening to music and reading a book about Taiping Heaven, in fact, this book is actually very hard to comprehend. Time goes fast, and after approximately two hours, we arrives at Chongqing City. And then, we took a taxi to the hotel we have reserved, and finally, meet up with the girl we have agreed to hang out together.</p>
<h3 id="Celebrate-Birthday"><a href="#Celebrate-Birthday" class="headerlink" title="Celebrate Birthday"></a>Celebrate Birthday</h3><p>After set up in the hotel, we all people become hungry, and trying to find something to eat, so in the nearby business cycle, we find a beef hotpot restaurant, and it is truly very light, but it meets all of our favour, emmmm, maybe. After that, we found a cafe to take a break, and started to chat with each other, in this process, I tried to be positive to catch up the interest of that girl, but Awkwardly, being a bit of silly. Long story short, in the evening, after we split up with girls, me and my brother went back to the hotel, and prepared to have a rest. And then, the girls followed us, and celebrating our birthday with a cake. Wow, it definitely surprised me, and it is the first time that I have my birthday celebrated with girls. I cannot tell the feelings, and I do know the tales about the three illusions in the lifetime, so, I have been trying to restrain my emotions, and hoping it works.</p>
<h2 id="Day-Two"><a href="#Day-Two" class="headerlink" title="Day Two"></a>Day Two</h2><h3 id="Watch-Movies"><a href="#Watch-Movies" class="headerlink" title="Watch Movies"></a>Watch Movies</h3><p>The weather in Chongqing is so hot, and in the day two, we get up in the late 10 am, and go to eat the Chongqing noodles as a breakfast. After that, we go to eat a chicken, which is spicy, but yummy. In the afternoon, we decided to go to watch movie together, which is produced in domestic, called “A or B”. In fact, this movie is not very good, I mean, not as good as I expected. But it is not important, cause, during this time, I do go to watch movies with a girl, it is a new experience for me, and it might be hard for me to forget. It would the most precious part in my whole life. But anyway, I do remember the story about “Three Illusions in the Life Time”. To sum up, it cheers me up, but also makes me sad sometimes. </p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>What happened in Chongqing City is amazing, and it actually confused me. After I come back to Chengdu City, my brother and his girl said it seems that there is not chance between me and that girl. Well, it breaks my heart for a moment. And I actually cannot get to know my real feeling, for I … Indeed, the details I have observed from the girl actually attracted me to some extent, specifically, is about her characters, her profiles, her smiles, and sometimes her behaviors. These tiny parts are not the elements which makes me crazy, but truly comforts me to a large degree. I do not know what would happen, but I would keep this memory, by recording it in my personal blog.</p>
<p>Hope that no one would read these words except me.</p>
